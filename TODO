High Level issues:
=================
If you want to help in any of the following areas ... PLEASE jump in.


Platforms:

Get to work on other platforms (See INSTALL for details).

Quality:

* Complete test suite to test all APIs.
* Performance analysys and improvements.

Documentation:

* Move all API docs into POD, so they are accessible via perldoc

Samples:

* More example applications


Internals:
==========
Mon Jun  2 11:04:34 MDT 2003
* make a fatal error if someone is using the wrong version of Xerces-C

Fri Oct 11 21:57:23 MDT 2002
* the %typecheck for XMLCh* is too greedy, it shouldn't happen later
  in the typecheck process

Fri Jun  7 00:37:01 MDT 2002
* make entity resolver to find all the xml files

Sun Jun  2 11:38:11 MDT 2002
Fixed ==> * move transcoder initialization from postSource.pl to an
  %init block
Fixed ==> * use SWIG macro for multiple methods which use same exception
* use %newobject and %typemape(newfree) for methods like removeNode()
* look into use %feature("shadow") instead of having stuff in
  postModule.pl
* look into using SWIG_RegisterMapping() instead of inheritance hack

Mon Mar 25 00:37:58 MST 2002
Fixed ==> * callbacks for DOM_NodeFilter
Fixed ==> * test for TreeWalker

Thu Mar 21 08:49:08 MST 2002
Fixed ==> * implement a way to export IDOM documents (see RE: IDOM memory model
  in xerces-c-dev)

Fri Jan 18 23:36:20 MST 2002
Fixed ==> * DOM_Document::getElementById() segfaults on undef ID

Fri Nov  2 23:07:43 MST 2001
Won't do ==> * Make XML::Xerces::XMLString class and have SWIG convert all XMLCh
  arrays to these. This should eliminate a lot of transcoding.
Won't do ==> * Provide all needed XMLString operators:
  - stringify
  - . (.=)
  - eq (neq)
Fixed ==> * Remove DOMString support

Mon Sep 24 20:17:58 MDT 2001
Fixed ==> * REAL EXCEPTION HANDLING via eval{}/die();
  - throw exception objects
Fixed ==>  - never call cerr, use croak()
* Finish conversion of Xerces.i to SWIG-1.3.8
  - sax
  - sax2
Fixed ==>  - util
* overloaded constructors for XMLPScanToken
* overloaded constructors for QName
Fixed ==>* overloaded constructors for XMLUri
* overloaded constructors for SAX*Exception
Fixed ==>* overloaded method for AttributeList::getValue
Fixed ==>* overloaded method for AttributeList::getType
Fixed ==>* overloaded method for XMLReaderFactory::createReaderFactory
Fixed ==>* overloaded method for Attributes::getValue
Fixed ==>* overloaded method for Attributes::getType
Fixed ==>* overloaded method for Attributes::getIndex

* Add tests for IDOM untested features
Fixed ==> * Add tests for DOM untested features (should we do this if DOM is
  to be replaced by IDOM ==> low priority)

Mon Sep 10 21:28:51 MDT 2001
Fixed ==> * Fix MemBufInputSource::new() so that it doesn't require the string
* check memory repeated re-use of parser
* only create DESTROY methods for objects with C++ data to be deleted,
  that should be directly invoked, i.e. not inherited methods

Sat Apr 14 17:30:46 MST 2001
* Implement a tied hash interface for NamedNodeMap
* Implement a tied array for NodeList
